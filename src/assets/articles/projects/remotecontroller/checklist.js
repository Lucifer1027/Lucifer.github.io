      val: "For this project, I have chosen Raspberry Pi Zero W for it supports WLAN and Bluetooth connection. Also, Raspberry Pi has a relatively big community so I could implement the voice recognition algorithm later on. However, you could also use other Raspberry boards as long as it supports the WLAN connection (Although it might not fit in the protection case). Technically speaking, if you only need the basic functionalities, you could choose whatever board you want. All youâ€™ll need is to rewrite the codes in a different language, but the program skeleton will remain the same."
