This is a blog site that records some of my projects and notes.

### Project setup
Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Some Issues:
1. The navigation bar and the actual is not connected, which means it might create some redundant navigation issues in router.vue
2. Need to add picture panel in Article.vue.
3. The collapse does not work.
4. The chapter name does not change with the artical content. It is hard coded which is pretty hard to change article content. Need to be improved.
5. The way I wrote code blocks are not very decent. I'll find a better way later.
